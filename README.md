# Smart-Health-Band
Overview    
    Wearable Technologies are devices which can be worn by the user & simultaneously process and display relevant information on the wearer. Wearables are considered as the biggest innovation in technology since the smart phone â€“ and the possibilities are endless.
		In the proposed work, a Health Monitoring Wearable Glove which can be worn is built and used to display the heart rate of any individual on the display mounted on the glove. The pulse of a person is sensed using a pulse sensor, which sends information to the Arduino board & it subsequently processes the information and commands the display module to display the heart-rate.
